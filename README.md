### About the Experiment 

Fuzzy inference is the process of formulating the mapping from a given input to an output using fuzzy logic. The mapping then provides a basis from which decisions can be made, or patterns discerned. The process of fuzzy inference involves Membership Functions, Logical Operations, and If-Then Rules. You can implement two types of fuzzy inference systems in the toolbox: Mamdani-type and Sugeno-type. These two types of inference systems vary somewhat in the way outputs are determined.
